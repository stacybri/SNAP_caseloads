Abstract:

Since the 1990s, states received unprecedented flexibility to determine Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility and program administration. We find state SNAP policies accounted for nearly half of the 2000-2016 caseload increase. State economic conditions also play an important role in caseload changes, accounting for almost half of the 2007 through 2013 increase. Within distinct periods of our 1990 through 2016 data, policy and the economy make different contributions to caseload changes. Policy simulations indicate that mandating states to maintain their 2000 SNAP policies, prior to the greatest expansion in latitude, would have lowered 2000-2016 caseload growth by 38 percent.
